# Cortana-App
Tired of Cortana constantly misinterpreting your apps? Customize the keywords for your applications so she can access them more easily! WINDOWS only


I made this little application when I was bored on a Thursday. Basically, it just creates a shortcut for your application where Cortana <i>usually</i> looks for applications. She's supposed to search your File Explorer, but I noticed she kept going <b>straight</b> to Microsoft Edge which was infuriating. So, this app is allows you to rename shortcuts for your .exe files really quickly. That way, you can call up your apps without so much pain and hassle.

It's built <b>only</b> for Windows 10 (because Cortana is only for Windows 10). 

# HOW-TO-INSTALL

Just download the "app" directory (the 3 DLL files and the 1 .exe file). I am using the other files for testing/debugging.
